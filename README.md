# JanSaathi
JanSaathi is an innovative digital civic management platform designed to bridge the gap between citizens, municipal authorities, and contractors. It enables citizens to report civic issues like potholes, broken roads, waterlogging, or exposed live wires quickly and transparently, while providing authorities with a centralised dashboard for tracking, managing, and resolving complaints. Contractors can bid competitively for tasks, ensuring cost-effective and timely work.

By combining technology, transparency, and gamification, JanSaathi encourages active civic participation and builds trust between the public and administration.
